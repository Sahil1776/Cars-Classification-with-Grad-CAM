- Managed Stanford Cars' dataset containing more than 8k images of 196 types of cars with bounding box labels. 
- Trained a 34-layered residual network on the dataset for classification using PyTorch.
- Implemented grad-cam on the weakest class to best determine the next steps in improving the algorithm.
